## Agda Resources

Here is a short list of Agda resources that I have found helpful.  
Most of them, and many others, can be found on the long list of references accompanying [Jan Malakovski's tutorial](http://oxij.org/note/BrutalDepTypes/).  

+ [Learn You an Agda](http://williamdemeo.github.io/2014/02/27/learn-you-an-agda/), a modified version of [Liam O'Connor's introductory tutorial](http://learnyouanagda.liamoc.net/).
+ [Dependent Types at Work](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/DependentTypesAtWork.pdf), by Ana Bove and Peter Dybjer.
+ [Computer Aided Formal Reasoning](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/g53cfr/)
  course by [Thorsten Altenkirch](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/).
+ [Agda Tutorial](https://people.inf.elte.hu/divip/AgdaTutorial/Index.html) by Péter Diviánszky.
+ [Dependently Typed Programming in Agda](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf), by Ulf Norell and James Chapman.

The OPLSS subdirectory contains some resources from Agda tutorials offered at the Oregon Programming
Languages Summer School.
