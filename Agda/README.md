## Agda Resources

Here is a short list of Agda resources that I have found helpful.  
Most of them, and many others, can be found on the long list of references accompanying [Jan Malakovski's tutorial](http://oxij.org/note/BrutalDepTypes/).  

+ [Learn You an Agda](http://williamdemeo.github.io/2014/02/27/learn-you-an-agda/), a modified version of [Liam O'Connor's introductory tutorial](http://learnyouanagda.liamoc.net/).
+ [Introductory tutorial](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/agda.html), by Stephen Diehl.
+ [Dependent Types at Work](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/DependentTypesAtWork.pdf), by Ana Bove and Peter Dybjer. 
+ [Dependently Typed Programming in Agda](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf), by Ulf Norell and James Chapman.

The OPLSS subdirectory contains some resources from Agda tutorials offered at the Oregon Programming
Languages Summer School.
